# MiniProject
# Individual
# C Programming
# To apply the learning

# What it must contain
* Folder structure must be as per https://github.com/stepin654321/MiniProject_Template/tree/master/MiniProject_c
* 100 lines of code , Excluding printf and scanf
  * functions
  * pointers
  * unit testing
  * multifile progrramming (.c files, . files and/or Library files)
  * makefile based compilation for windows and linux
  * code documentation - Doxgen
# System development life cycle
  # requirements for your project
    * what, why, when, who, how
    * Analysis strength, weakness, oppurtunity, threats
    * high level(feature) and low level requirements (how is it implimented)
  # design
    * structural
    * behavioural
  # implement
     * c program based implementation
  # test plan and outcome
     * how is the feature tested/ verified - steps for each requirement captured (HLR & LLR)
     * once implemented, test and capture the outcome
# Development tools
  * build tools - gcc
  * Makefiles
  * Analysis
    * static - beforre code execution - cppcheck
